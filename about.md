Hello. Here is a little blurb about me.

I'm a Senior UI Developer, currently specializing in Data Visualization at The Weather Company. I constantly seek new coding best practices and workflows. I love to learn and I love to teach. I am thankful for those that helped me learn to code better throughout my career, and I enjoy giving back and helping others. I've used a number of web technologies including JavaScript, NodeJS, AngularJS, KnockoutJS, Aurelia, D3, jQuery, SASS/CSS, HTML, and even Flash, and Flex. .
