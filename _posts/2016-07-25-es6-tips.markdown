Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

{% highlight js linenos %}

var num1 = 101;
var num2 = 58;
var total = num1 + num2;

function getTotal(){
  return total;
}

{% endhighlight %}
