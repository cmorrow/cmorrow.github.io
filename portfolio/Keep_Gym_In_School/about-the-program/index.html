According to the American Heart Association and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the rates for overweight children have doubled over the last two decades, and today, 12.5 million children and adolescents in the United States are considered overweight.</p> <h2>Problem / Background</h2> <p>In the face of this staggering problem, fewer than 8% of middle schools provide daily physical education for the entire school year for students. Physical Education classes not only give children an opportunity to be active but also give them the skills they need to be active throughout their lifetime.</p> <p>NFL Network has recognized this growing health problem and is reinvesting in our nation’s physical education programs. Keep Gym in School addresses these health concerns by giving students the opportunity for quality physical education and the ability to establish and sustain healthy lifestyles.</p> <h2>Keep Gym In School Overview:</h2> <h3>School Adoptions</h3> <p>Keep Gym in School has adopted four deserving middle schools to help deliver quality physical education opportunities to all students. We are refurbishing facilities, providing funding for physical education instructors and supplying needed equipment. </p> <h3>NFL “Minicamps” and Fitness Challenge </h3> <p>Each adopted school will compete in an “In-School Fitness Challenge” to assess student fitness, motivate students to stay active and allow teachers to monitor student progress throughout the year. The challenges will be kicked off with a “minicamp” event that will be led by participating NFL players.</p> <h3>Lesson Plans</h3> <p>Keep Gym in School has partnered with National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) to develop instructional and educational content designed to get kids excited about PE. To get these new football-inspired lesson plans and activities into schools, local NFL teams will host teacher training camps for all middle school physical educators in each district of our adopted schools. These lesson plans can be downloaded by clicking <a href="pdf/NFL_GymLessonPlans.pdf">here</a>.</p> <h3>National School Adoption Grant</h3> <p>To expand the program nationally, Keep Gym in School will provide one additional school with a $10,000 grant to improve its physical education program.</p> <h3>President’s Challenge </h3> <p>Keep Gym in School has partnered with the President’s Challenge, a program of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, to create the “Keep Gym in School Challenge.” With this program, individuals can engage in activities and track their progress to earn special Presidential awards recognizing their accomplishments.</p> <h3>Public Service Campaign</h3> <p>We are creating a series of Keep Gym in School Public Service Announcements featuring NFL players Antwaan Randle El (Washington Redskins), Donnie Edwards (Kansas City Chiefs), Kurt Warner (Arizona Cardinals), and Deuce McAllister (New Orleans Saints). These exciting spots will run on NFL Network, during NFL games on broadcast partners, and as cross-channel spots on the Cox affiliates.</p> <h3>Keep Gym in School National Honors at NFL Draft Weekend 2009</h3> <p>NFL Network will host a national honors event in New York City during NFL Draft Weekend, April 20-26, to recognize our national grant winner as well as teachers and top-performing students from each adopted school.</p> </div> </div> <div id=contentDivider><img src="images/bgContentDivTop.gif" alt=""/></div> <div id=contentRight> <div id=nominate class=iconDiv> <h2>Nominate Your School</h2> <p>Help make a difference in your community!
